* Push all the code for exercise-2 here. 
* This code should focus on building a custom Keras-estimator
* Input pipeline should be optimised. TF-Records creation is preferred.
* Tensorboard integration is a must. 
* Run the code in local (Local-estimator) and attach the screenshot of progress in local and tensorboard. 


Open a merge request and assign it to one of the mentors, for review.
